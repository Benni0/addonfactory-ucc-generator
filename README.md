### Prerequisite
We uses bower, grunt and webpack to build the Universal Configuration Console.

### Install bower and configure it
Follow the setup steps here: [http://repo.splunk.com/artifactory/webapp/#/artifacts/browse/tree/General/bower | bower setup]
Note: you must install art-resolver to use splunk bower repo
```
npm install -g bower-art-resolver
```

### Use the following command to build an example add-on
```
python update_version.py
cd ./UCC-UI-lib && npm install && bower install
cd ./UCC-example-addon && python setup.py && source ${SPLUNK_HOME}/bin/setSplunkEnv && python build.py
```

### Implementation of a hook feature.

Step 1: Add hook in configuration tab at the entity level.

```
// adding hook in configuration tab

"configuration": {
     "title": "Configurations",
     "description": "Configure your servers and templates.",
      "tabs": [
          {
              "name": "templates",
              "title": "Templates",
               "table": {...
          },
          "entity": [...
          ],
           "hook": {
               "src": "customHook"
          }
       }
    ]
}
```

Step 2: Create custom/customHook.js

* Copy `./UCC-UI-lib/package/appserver/static/js/views/controls/Hook.js` to `${SPLUNK_HOME}/etc/apps/${UCC_GENERATED_APP}/appserver/static/js/build/custom/` folder and rename it to `customHook.js`
* Add app-level business logic in custom code in `customHook.js`.


### OAuth support for UCC:
Out of the box support for oauth has been added to the UCC.<br/>
Below is the global config example for the same:

```
// adding oauth support in accounts tab

"configuration": {
     "title": "Configurations",
     "description": "Configure your servers and templates.",
     "tabs": [
          {
              "name": "account",
              "title": "Account",
               "table": {...
               },
              "entity": [
                   {
                            "field": "name",
                            "label": "Name",
                            "type": "text",
                            "required": true,
                            "help": "Enter a unique name for each Crowdstrike falcon host account.",
                        },
                        {
                        type:"oauth",
                        "field": "oauth",
                        "label":"Not used",
                        "options": {
                                "auth_type": ["basic", "oauth"],
                                "basic": [
                                     {
                                        "oauth_field": "username",

                                        "help": "Enter Account name."
                                    },
                                    {
                                        "oauth_field": "password",

                                    },
                                    {

                                "auth_code_endpoint":"/services/oauth2/authorize",
                                "access_token_endpoint":"/services/oauth2/token"
                            }    
                   }

          }
     ]
}

```
Below is the explanation of each field:
* type field value must be `oauth`.
* Options:
     * `auth_type` must be present. It can have either `["basic", "oauth"]` (if we want basic and oauth both support) or `["oauth"]` (if we want oauth support only).
     * `basic` this must be present only if `basic` is provided in `auth_type`. <br/>
        This will have list of fields you want to add in basic authentication flow. <br/> 
        In the given example, it is `username`, `password` and  `security token`. <br/>
        Please not that as of now, if you are selecting basic auth. `username` and `password` is mandatory field.
     * `oauth` this must be present if `oauth` is provided in `auth_type`. <br/>
        This will have list of fields you want to add in oauth authentication flow. <br/>
        In the given example, it is `client_id`,`client_secret`,`redirect_url`,`endpoint`. <br/>
        These fields are mandatory.<br/>
        * `client_id` this is client id for the your app for which you want auth<br/>
        * `client_secret` this is client secret for the your app for which you want auth<br/>
        * `redirect_url` this will show redirect url which needs to be put in app's redirect url.<br/>
        * `endpoint` this will be endpoint for which we want to build oauth support. For example for salesforce that will be either "login.salesforce.com" or "test.salesforce.com" or any other custom endpoint.<br/>
         This field is can be present as part of normal fields as there can be scenario that this is required in both basic and oauth authentication. But it should be present at any of the place to oauth to work.
     *  `auth_code_endpoint` this must be present and its value should be endpoint value for getting the auth_code using the app. If the url to get auth_code is `https://login.salesforce.com/services/oauth2/authorize` then this will have value `/services/oauth2/authorize` 
     *  `access_token_endpoint` this must be present and its value should be endpoint value for getting access_token using the auth_code received. If the url to get access token is `https://login.salesforce.com/services/oauth2/token` then this will have value `/services/oauth2/token`
     *  `auth_label` this allow user to have custom label for Auth Type dropdown
     *  `oauth_popup_width` width in pixels of the popup window that will open for oauth authentication(Optional, defaults to 600)
     *  `oauth_popup_height` height in pixels of the popup window that will open for oauth authentication(Optional, defaults to 600)
     *  `oauth_timeout` timeout in seconds for oauth authentication(Optional, defaults to 180 seconds)

* This complete block should be removed if the user does not want this oauth support.

* Fields allowed in `basic` and `oauth` fields as of now:
     * `oauth_field`: This should be kept as it is and without any change.
     * `label`: This can be changed if the user wants to change the label of the field in UI.
     * `field`: For now this user must keep it as it is for mandatory fields as mentioned above.
     * `help` : This can be changed if user wants to change the help text displayed below field.
     * `encrypted` : This should be true if user wants that particular field encrypted else no need to have this parameter.<br/>
    **No other fields apart from above mentioned fields are allowed as of now.**
    
Once user create/changes globalconfig.json as per above guidance. 
A build needs to be created which will be having support for oauth. 


Note:
* Replace ${SPLUNK_HOME} with real Splunk home path.
* Replace ${UCC_GENERATED_APP} with UCC Generated App name.
